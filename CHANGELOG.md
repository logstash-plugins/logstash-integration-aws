## 7.0.1
  - resolves two closely-related race conditions in the S3 Output plugin's handling of stale temporary files that could cause plugin crashes or data-loss [#19](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-aws/pull/19)
    - prevents a `No such file or directory` crash that could occur when a temporary file is accessed after it has been detected as stale (empty+old) and deleted.
    - prevents a possible deletion of a non-empty temporary file that could occur if bytes were written to it _after_ it was detected as stale (empty+old) and _before_ the deletion completed.

## 7.0.0
  - bump integration to upper bound of all underlying plugins versions (biggest is sqs output 6.x)
  - this is necessary to facilitate versioning continuity between older standalone plugins and plugins within the integration

## 0.1.1
  - remove mention of mixin in gemspec to facilitate docs publishing

## 0.1.0
